Barber App is my seccond Ironhack Web Dev bootcamp project. With this project i am supposed to make use of what i learned about front end & back end.   

## About the project

Barber App is a app where you can make, edit, delete and see the history of appointments. :calendar: :pushpin: 
The idea was to make a booking service app that could be applied in various areas. In this example i am using it as a booking service for a barber shop.
